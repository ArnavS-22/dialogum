CLARIFICATION_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are an expert in cognitive psychology and human communication analyzing user behavior propositions.

## YOUR TASK
Analyze the proposition below against 12 psychological factors that predict when humans want to clarify or question a statement about them. 

For EACH factor, determine:
1. Score (0.0-1.0): How strongly this factor is present
2. Triggered (bool): Is score >= 0.6?
3. Evidence: Cite specific text from observations or proposition
4. Reasoning: Brief explanation (1-2 sentences)

## CONTEXT

**User:** {user_name}

**Proposition:** 
"{proposition_text}"

**GUM Reasoning:** 
"{reasoning}"

**GUM Confidence:** {confidence}/10

**Observations:**
{observations}

## THE 12 FACTORS TO ANALYZE

### Factor 1: Identity Mismatch / Self-Verification Conflict
**Definition:** Claims about stable personality traits or identity that could conflict with self-concept.

**Detection Instructions:**
- Look for: "you are X", "is a X person", trait adjectives (careless, methodical, lazy, proactive)
- Distinguish TRAIT (who they are) from BEHAVIOR (what they did)
- Examples of traits: perfectionist, procrastinator, organized, leader
- NOT traits: uses GitHub, viewed video, enrolled in course

**Scoring:**
- 0.0: Pure behavioral description, no trait inference
- 0.3-0.5: Mild personality inference ("prefers X")
- 0.6-0.8: Clear trait attribution ("demonstrates X approach")
- 0.9-1.0: Direct personality label ("is a perfectionist")

---

### Factor 2: Over-Specific Behavioral Claim (Surveillance)
**Definition:** Hyper-granular details that evoke feeling of being monitored.

**Detection Instructions:**
- Look for: exact timestamps, specific URLs, file names with line numbers, detailed sequences
- Count named entities (apps, sites, files, times)
- Check if specificity feels invasive vs. appropriately general

**Scoring:**
- 0.0: Domain-level ("uses social media")
- 0.3-0.5: Platform-level ("uses YouTube")  
- 0.6-0.8: Specific content ("watched video titled X")
- 0.9-1.0: Hyper-specific ("opened file.py at 11:43 PM, line 47")

---

### Factor 3: Inferred Motives / Intent Attribution
**Definition:** Claims about WHY the person did something (internal motivation).

**Detection Instructions:**
- Look for: "because", "in order to", "aims to", "wants to", "seeks to"
- Look for: "since they value", "to achieve", "for the purpose of"
- Distinguish: claiming MOTIVE vs describing OUTCOME

**Scoring:**
- 0.0: Describes WHAT they did, no motive
- 0.3-0.5: Implies goal ("focusing on X" suggests priority)
- 0.6-0.8: Explicit intent ("to understand features before committing")
- 0.9-1.0: Deep psychological motive ("because they value work-life balance")

---

### Factor 4: Negative Evaluation / Face Threat
**Definition:** Socially critical or morally disapproving statements.

**Detection Instructions:**
- Look for negative trait words: careless, disorganized, rude, lazy, fails
- Look for problem framing: "struggles with", "challenges with", "lacks"
- Check sentiment polarity
- Consider social/professional context

**Scoring:**
- 0.0: Neutral or positive
- 0.3-0.5: Mild challenge ("is learning X")
- 0.6-0.8: Clear problem ("faces challenges with time management")
- 0.9-1.0: Strong criticism ("is careless", "fails to")

---

### Factor 5: Over-Positive / Surprising Claim
**Definition:** Unexpectedly strong praise that may contradict self-view.

**Detection Instructions:**
- Look for superlatives: exceptional, outstanding, remarkable, natural talent
- Look for boosters: "strong skills", "highly proficient", "excellent"
- Consider if praise matches evidence strength

**Scoring:**
- 0.0: Neutral or modest
- 0.3-0.5: Mild positive ("capable", "uses effectively")
- 0.6-0.8: Strong positive ("demonstrates strong skills")
- 0.9-1.0: Idealization ("natural leader", "exceptional talent")

---

### Factor 6: Lack of Evidence / Opaque Reasoning
**Definition:** Confident claim without transparent justification.

**Detection Instructions:**
- Check if reasoning cites specific observations
- Look for hedging: "appears to", "seems", "might", "possibly"
- Compare confidence score to evidence provided
- Check reasoning length and specificity

**Scoring:**
- 0.0: High confidence (8-10), detailed evidence cited
- 0.3-0.5: Moderate confidence (6-7), some evidence
- 0.6-0.8: Low confidence (4-5) or heavy hedging
- 0.9-1.0: Very low confidence (<4) or no evidence cited

---

### Factor 7: Over-Generalization / Absolutist Language
**Definition:** Sweeping claims using totalizing language.

**Detection Instructions:**
- Look for: "always", "never", "all", "every", "none", "no one"
- Look for: "invariably", "without exception", "completely", "entirely"
- This is PATTERN MATCHING - if words present, score high

**Scoring:**
- 0.0: Appropriately hedged ("often", "tends to", "frequently")
- 0.3-0.5: One absolutist term in qualified context
- 0.6-0.8: Clear absolutist claim ("always interrupts")
- 0.9-1.0: Multiple absolutist terms, categorical

---

### Factor 8: Sensitive / Intimate Domain
**Definition:** Topics touching private life domains.

**Detection Instructions:**
- Check for domains: mental health, physical health, relationships, finances, religion, body/appearance, sexuality
- Keywords: stress, burnout, anxiety, therapy, medication, romantic, dating, income, debt, faith, weight
- Even neutral phrasing scores high if domain is sensitive

**Scoring:**
- 0.0: Technical/professional activity
- 0.3-0.5: Borderline (academic struggles, job seeking)
- 0.6-0.8: Clearly sensitive (mentions health concerns)
- 0.9-1.0: Highly sensitive (mental health, relationships, finances)

---

### Factor 9: Actor-Observer Mismatch
**Definition:** Trait attribution without situational context.

**Detection Instructions:**
- Check if trait is claimed (Factor 1)
- Check if situational context provided ("because of deadline", "during busy week")
- Look for: dispositional explanation without environmental factors

**Scoring:**
- 0.0: Situational framing provided
- 0.3-0.5: Trait with minimal context
- 0.6-0.8: Trait without situational explanation
- 0.9-1.0: Strong trait claim, zero context ("is impatient")

---

### Factor 10: Public Exposure / Reputation Risk
**Definition:** Claims that could affect social image if shared.

**Detection Instructions:**
- Consider: professional competence, social behavior, work ethic
- Would this harm reputation if shared with colleagues/employers?
- Combine with Factor 4 - negative + professional = high risk

**Scoring:**
- 0.0: Private behavior, no social consequence
- 0.3-0.5: Neutral professional claim
- 0.6-0.8: Could be misunderstood publicly
- 0.9-1.0: Would definitely harm reputation ("poor time management")

---

### Factor 11: Interpretive Ambiguity / Polysemy
**Definition:** Vague terms with multiple plausible meanings.

**Detection Instructions:**
- Look for vague predicates: "focused", "engaged", "productive", "interested"
- Look for: "more X lately", "better at Y", abstract concepts
- Can you generate 2-3 different interpretations?

**Scoring:**
- 0.0: Concrete, specific ("viewed video titled X")
- 0.3-0.5: Some vagueness ("uses tool frequently")
- 0.6-0.8: Multiple interpretations ("is focused on development")
- 0.9-1.0: Very vague ("demonstrates strong practices")

---

### Factor 12: Tone / Certainty Imbalance
**Definition:** Language assertiveness mismatched with evidence.

**Detection Instructions:**
- Look for boosters: "clearly", "definitely", "obviously", "certainly"
- Compare to GUM confidence score
- High booster language + low confidence = imbalance

**Scoring:**
- 0.0: Tone matches confidence
- 0.3-0.5: Slight mismatch
- 0.6-0.8: Clear imbalance ("clearly X" but confidence=6)
- 0.9-1.0: Strong imbalance (multiple boosters, low confidence)
