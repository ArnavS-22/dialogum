# GUM Clarification Detection Benchmark Plan

## Executive Summary

**Goal:** Create a reproducible, research-grounded benchmark to evaluate how well our 12-factor clarification detection system identifies propositions that would trigger human clarification behavior.

**Core Insight:** We already have a valuable internal dataset (150 analyzed propositions) + access to AmbiEnt dataset (1,645 examples) from our reference implementations. We can combine these to create both intrinsic factor accuracy measures and extrinsic human alignment measures.

---

## 1. Problem Scope & Objectives

### 1.1 What We're Measuring

**Primary Task:** Binary classification - does a proposition about a person trigger ≥1 of the 12 psychological clarification factors?

**Secondary Tasks:**
- Multi-label factor detection (which of the 12 factors are present?)
- Regression: how strongly does each factor apply? (0.0-1.0)
- Aggregate scoring: overall clarification urgency (0.0-1.0)

**Success Criteria:**
- **Factor Detection Accuracy:** Can we correctly identify when each factor is present?
- **Human Alignment:** Do propositions we flag actually prompt clarification when shown to humans?
- **Robustness:** Does performance hold across proposition types (identity claims, behavioral patterns, intent inferences)?
- **Efficiency:** Cost per analysis, latency

### 1.2 Audience & Use Cases

- **Internal:** Tune our LLM prompts, aggregation weights, threshold
- **Research:** Validate that the 12-factor framework generalizes beyond GUM
- **Future Work:** Allow alternative detection methods to compare against our baseline

---

## 2. Benchmark Components

### 2.1 Dataset Design

#### **Dataset A: GUM Internal Gold Set (Human-Labeled)**

**Source:** Sample 200-300 propositions from our database, stratified by:
- Confidence score (low/medium/high)
- Length (short/medium/long)
- Observation count (sparse/moderate/rich context)

**Annotation Process:**
1. **Annotators:** 2-3 human raters (diverse backgrounds: psychology-aware, domain expert, naive user)
2. **Task:** For each proposition + observations context:
   - Binary: "Would you want to clarify or question this if it was said about YOU?" (Yes/No)
   - Multi-select: "Which concerns apply?" (map to 12 factors)
   - Open text: "Why? What would you ask?"
3. **Guidelines:** 10-page annotation manual with:
   - Definition of each factor in plain language
   - 3 positive examples, 3 negative examples per factor
   - Edge case handling (e.g., trait vs. behavior distinction)
4. **Quality Control:**
   - Pilot batch: 20 propositions, all annotators, measure Cohen's κ
   - Train until κ ≥ 0.65 (substantial agreement)
   - Final: Each proposition gets 2 annotations, resolve conflicts via discussion

**Output Schema:**
```json
{
  "proposition_id": 123,
  "proposition_text": "...",
  "observations": [...],
  "annotations": [
    {
      "annotator_id": "A1",
      "needs_clarification": true,
      "factors_present": [1, 3, 4],
      "factor_scores": {"identity_mismatch": 0.8, "inferred_intent": 0.6, ...},
      "clarification_question": "When you say I'm 'careless', what specific behavior are you referring to?",
      "confidence": 0.9
    },
    {
      "annotator_id": "A2",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "consensus": {
    "needs_clarification": true,
    "factors_triggered": [1, 3],
    "agreement": 0.85
  }
}
```

**Split:**
- Train: 0 (we don't train, this is for prompt engineering iteration)
- Validation: 100 (tune threshold, weights)
- Test: 100-200 (held-out, final evaluation)

**Cost Estimate:**
- 200 props × 2 annotators × $0.50/prop = $200
- 20 hours annotation time @ $25/hr = $500
- **Total: ~$700**

---

#### **Dataset B: AmbiEnt Adaptation (Factor 11 Benchmark)**

**Source:** `reference_implementations/ambient/AmbiEnt/` (1,645 examples)

**Relevance:** AmbiEnt tests interpretive ambiguity (our Factor 11). Each example has:
- A premise statement
- Multiple valid interpretations (disambiguations)
- Linguist annotations

**Adaptation Strategy:**
1. Reformat AmbiEnt premises as GUM-style propositions
2. Map to Factor 11 scoring:
   - 0.0: Unambiguous (1 interpretation)
   - 0.5: Moderate ambiguity (2 interpretations)
   - 1.0: High ambiguity (3+ interpretations)
3. Use as **Factor 11 validation set**

**Example Mapping:**
```json
// AmbiEnt original
{
  "premise": "I saw a man with binoculars.",
  "labels": "neutral, entailment",
  "disambiguations": [
    {"premise": "I saw a man who had binoculars.", "label": "entailment"},
    {"premise": "I used binoculars to see a man.", "label": "neutral"}
  ]
}

// GUM adaptation
{
  "proposition": "You saw a man with binoculars.",
  "interpretations": 2,
  "factor_11_ground_truth": 0.65,
  "evidence": "Structural ambiguity: PP-attachment ('with binoculars' modifies 'man' or 'saw')"
}
```

**Usage:** 
- Validate our Factor 11 (ambiguity) detection against research-grade labels
- Test: Does our LLM prompt correctly identify ambiguity at the same rate as linguists?

---

#### **Dataset C: Synthetic Stress Tests (Robustness)**

**Purpose:** Controlled adversarial examples to test factor boundaries

**Construction:** For each factor, create:
- 5 minimal positive examples (just barely triggers)
- 5 minimal negative examples (just barely doesn't trigger)
- 5 confounders (looks like factor X but is actually Y)

**Example for Factor 1 (Identity Mismatch):**
```python
# Positive (minimal trait)
"You demonstrate organized thinking." # score ~0.6

# Negative (behavior, not trait)  
"You organized your files yesterday." # score ~0.1

# Confounder (looks like trait, but is preference)
"You prefer organized workspaces." # score ~0.3
```

**Total:** 12 factors × 15 examples = 180 propositions

**Annotation:** Author-curated with expert validation

---

### 2.2 Evaluation Metrics

#### **Primary Metrics**

1. **Binary Classification (needs_clarification)**
   - **Accuracy:** Overall % correct
   - **Precision:** Of flagged props, what % truly need clarification?
   - **Recall:** Of props that need clarification, what % did we catch?
   - **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean (precision + recall)
   - **ROC-AUC:** Discrimination ability across thresholds

2. **Per-Factor Detection (multi-label)**
   - **Per-factor F1:** For each of the 12 factors independently
   - **Hamming Loss:** Fraction of factors incorrectly predicted
   - **Exact Match Ratio:** % where all 12 factors exactly correct

3. **Score Calibration (regression)**
   - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** |predicted_score - human_score|
   - **Pearson r:** Correlation between predicted and human scores
   - **Spearman ρ:** Rank correlation (order preservation)

#### **Secondary Metrics**

4. **Robustness**
   - **Subgroup Accuracy:** Performance on low-conf vs high-conf props
   - **Length Sensitivity:** Does performance degrade with long/short props?
   - **Inter-Rater Agreement Correlation:** Does our system agree more with high-agreement human pairs?

5. **Efficiency**
   - **Cost per Analysis:** Average OpenAI API cost
   - **Latency:** Time from proposition to result (p50, p95)
   - **Validation Pass Rate:** % that pass evidence-citation checks

6. **Explainability**
   - **Evidence Citation Rate:** % of triggered factors with valid evidence
   - **Reasoning Quality:** Human rating of LLM explanations (1-5 scale)

---

### 2.3 Baselines & Oracles

#### **Baselines**

1. **Random:** Predict 50% clarification rate (floor)
2. **Rule-Based Heuristics:** Simple pattern matching:
   - Factor 7: Regex for "always|never|all"
   - Factor 2: Count named entities > 3
   - Factor 12: Check for boosters ("clearly", "definitely")
   - Aggregate via OR (any factor → flag)
3. **Confidence-Only:** Flag all props with GUM confidence < 6
4. **Keyword Baseline:** TF-IDF on proposition text → logistic regression
5. **Our System (GPT-4-turbo, v1.0 prompt):** Current implementation
6. **Ablations:**
   - Without validation layer
   - Without observation context (proposition only)
   - Single-factor prompts (12 separate LLM calls) vs unified

#### **Oracle (Upper Bound)**

- **Human-Human Agreement:** Inter-annotator F1 (theoretical ceiling)
- **Perfect Factor Detection:** Assume we know ground-truth factors, test only aggregation

## 3. Evaluation Protocol

### 3.1 Test Procedure (Reproducible)

#### **Environment Setup**
```bash
# Python 3.11, specific library versions
python -m venv benchmark_env
pip install -r benchmark_requirements.txt

# benchmark_requirements.txt
openai==1.12.0
sqlalchemy==2.0.27
scikit-learn==1.4.0
pandas==2.2.0
numpy==1.26.4
```

#### **Data Preprocessing**
```python
# Standard text normalization
def preprocess_proposition(text: str) -> str:
    text = text.strip()
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)  # collapse whitespace
    return text

# Observation formatting (consistent)
def format_observations(obs_list: list) -> str:
    return "\n".join([f"{i+1}. {obs['text'][:200]}..." for i, obs in enumerate(obs_list)])
```

#### **Inference Settings**
- **Model:** `gpt-4-turbo` (frozen version: `gpt-4-1106-preview`)
- **Temperature:** 0.1 (low variance)
- **Random Seed:** 42 (for reproducibility where applicable)
- **Prompt Version:** v1.0 (locked, checksummed)
- **Runs:** 3 independent runs on test set, report mean ± std

#### **Aggregation Logic**
```python
# L-infinity norm (max score across factors)
def aggregate_score(factor_scores: dict) -> float:
    return max(factor_scores.values())

# Threshold decision
def needs_clarification(aggregate_score: float, threshold: float = 0.61) -> bool:
    return aggregate_score >= threshold
```

#### **Statistical Testing**
- **Paired t-test:** Compare our system vs baselines (same test set)
- **McNemar's test:** For binary classification comparisons
- **Bonferroni correction:** Adjust p-values for multiple comparisons (5 baselines)
- **Significance level:** α = 0.05

---

### 3.2 Robustness Tests

#### **Distribution Shift**

1. **Domain Shift:** Test on propositions from different contexts:
   - Academic behavior (study habits)
   - Professional behavior (work patterns)
   - Personal behavior (leisure activities)
   - Social behavior (communication style)

2. **Noisy Input:** Inject controlled noise:
   - Typos (5% character substitution)
   - Missing observations (drop 50% randomly)
   - Truncated reasoning (cut at 50 chars)

3. **Adversarial Examples:** Propositions designed to fool factors:
   - "You are good at organizing" (trait? or skill description?)
   - "You always use best practices" (absolutist + positive → confusing)

#### **Subgroup Analysis**

Break down performance by:
- **Confidence bins:** [0-3], [4-6], [7-10]
- **Length bins:** <50 chars, 50-150, >150
- **Factor count:** Props with 0, 1, 2-3, 4+ factors triggered
- **Observation richness:** <5 obs, 5-15, >15

Report: Does accuracy drop for any subgroup?

## 4. Annotation & Quality Control

### 4.1 Annotation Guidelines (Condensed)

#### **Task Instructions**

> "You will see a proposition about a person, along with the observations (evidence) that support it. Imagine this proposition was made ABOUT YOU by an AI system that monitors your behavior.
>
> **Your task:**
> 1. Would you want to clarify, question, or push back on this statement? (Yes/No)
> 2. If yes, what concerns do you have? (Select all that apply from 12 factors)
> 3. What would you ask to clarify?"

#### **Per-Factor Checklist (Simplified)**

| Factor | Key Question | Positive Signal | Negative Signal |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1. Identity | Does it label who I AM (trait)? | "You are organized" | "You organized files" |
| 2. Surveillance | Hyper-specific details? | "Opened file.py at 11:43 PM" | "Uses development tools" |
| 3. Intent | Claims WHY I did it? | "to avoid responsibility" | "You completed task X" |
| 4. Face Threat | Socially critical? | "careless", "fails at" | Neutral description |
| 5. Over-Positive | Unexpectedly strong praise? | "exceptional talent" | "capable user" |
| 6. Opacity | Confident but no clear evidence? | High score, vague reasoning | Cites specific observations |
| 7. Absolutist | "Always", "never", "all"? | Present → flag | Hedged language |
| 8. Sensitive | Health, money, relationships? | Present → flag | Professional/technical |
| 9. Actor-Observer | Trait without context? | "is impatient" (no reason) | "rushed due to deadline" |
| 10. Reputation | Could harm image publicly? | "poor teamwork skills" | Private neutral behavior |
| 11. Ambiguity | Multiple meanings possible? | "focused on growth" | "viewed video titled X" |
| 12. Tone Imbalance | "Clearly X" but low confidence? | "Definitely" + score=5 | Tone matches confidence |

#### **Edge Cases**

- **Borderline trait:** "You prefer organized systems" → Score Factor 1 as 0.3 (preference, not identity)
- **Implied intent:** "You focus on security" → Score Factor 3 as 0.4 (suggests priority, not explicit motive)
- **Positive + negative:** "You're improving at time management" → Factor 4 score 0.5 (implies past deficit)

### 4.2 Inter-Annotator Agreement Target

- **Pilot Phase (20 examples):**
  - Target: Cohen's κ ≥ 0.65 (substantial)
  - If κ < 0.65: revise guidelines, retrain, re-pilot
  
- **Full Annotation:**
  - Report κ per factor (expect 0.50-0.80 range, varies by factor)
  - Report overall binary agreement (needs_clarification)
  - Include confusion matrix: which factors have most disagreement?

### 4.3 Conflict Resolution

- **2-annotator agreement → consensus:** No resolution needed
- **2-annotator disagreement:**
  - If minor (1 factor difference): Use union (flag if either annotator flagged)
  - If major (≥3 factor difference): Bring in 3rd annotator, majority vote

- **PII Handling:** All user names replaced with "User" or pseudonyms
- **Sensitive Content:** Flag but do not exclude propositions touching Factor 8 (sensitive domains)
  - Include content warning in benchmark documentation
  - Allow methods to opt-out of sensitive subset

### 6.2 Annotator Safety

- **Informed Consent:** Annotators told they'll read AI-generated propositions, some potentially sensitive
- **Support:** Provide mental health resources if annotators encounter distressing content
- **Fair Compensation:** $25/hour (above minimum wage)

### 6.3 Licensing

- **Benchmark Dataset:** CC BY 4.0 (same as AmbiEnt)
- **Code:** MIT License
- **AmbiEnt Reuse:** Compliant with original CC BY 4.0 license, cite Liu et al. 2023

### 6.4 Known Limitations & Risks

- **Cultural Bias:** 12 factors derived from Western psychology literature; may not generalize globally
- **Misuse Risk:** Could be used to manipulate users by avoiding clarification triggers (adversarial)
- **Labeling Subjectivity:** Ground truth is human perception, inherently variable
- **Model Dependency:** Benchmark designed for LLM-based systems; may not suit other architectures

**Mitigation:** Document limitations, encourage diverse annotator pools, prohibit adversarial use in license

## 10. Connection to Research Literature

### 10.1 Existing Benchmarks (Partial Overlap)

| Benchmark | Overlap with Our Factors | Gap |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----|
| **AmbiEnt (EMNLP 2023)** | Factor 11 (Ambiguity) | Doesn't cover other 11 factors |
| **Stanford Politeness (ACL 2013)** | Factor 4 (Face Threat), Factor 12 (Tone) | Requests, not propositions |
| **ETHICS (ICLR 2021)** | Factor 4 (moral judgments) | Binary good/bad, not clarification |
| **BOLD (FAccT 2021)** | Factor 10 (Reputation) | Bias in generation, not detection |
| **HellaSwag (ACL 2019)** | (Commonsense) | Not about clarification |

**Key Insight:** No existing benchmark tests all 12 factors in personal behavioral propositions → **ours fills a gap**

### 10.2 Evaluation Paradigms We Borrow

1. **GLUE/SuperGLUE:** Multi-task benchmark with leaderboard
2. **SQuAD:** Evidence-based QA with exact match + F1
3. **Adversarial NLI:** Synthetic stress tests for robustness
4. **Datasheets for Datasets (Gebru et al.):** Documentation standards
5. **Model Cards (Mitchell et al.):** Transparent model reporting

### 10.3 Novel Contributions

- **First benchmark for clarification trigger detection** across 12 psychological factors
- **Hybrid intrinsic (per-factor) + extrinsic (human alignment) evaluation**
- **Research-grounded:** Every factor backed by citation (Swann, Goffman, Malle, etc.)
- **Practical:** Uses real GUM propositions from personal informatics domain

| **Single metric obsession** | Report 6+ metrics (F1, accuracy, ROC-AUC, MAE, cost, latency) |
| **Stale baselines** | Include recent strong baseline (GPT-4-turbo) + ablations |
| **Annotation drift** | Pilot phase, regular agreement checks, conflict resolution protocol |
| **Dataset bias** | Stratified sampling, subgroup analysis, document limitations |
| **Unclear protocol** | Exact preprocessing, inference settings, seed, version |
| **Poor documentation** | 10-page guidelines, datasheet, model card, full code release |

## Appendix B: Annotation Interface Mockup

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
GUM CLARIFICATION BENCHMARK - ANNOTATION TASK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Proposition ID: 123 / 200

Context:
An AI system observed your computer activity and made this statement ABOUT YOU:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ "You demonstrate careless editing habits."  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Evidence (Observations):
1. Typed "teh" multiple times without correcting
2. Deleted and retyped same paragraph 3 times
3. Left unclosed parenthesis in code

GUM Confidence: 8/10


QUESTION 1: Would you want to clarify or question this statement?
○ Yes, I would ask for clarification
○ No, I accept it as is

[If Yes selected:]

QUESTION 2: What concerns do you have? (Select all that apply)

☐ Identity Label (calls me careless as a TRAIT)
☐ Too Specific (hyper-detailed monitoring)
☐ Assumes My Motives (why I did something)
☐ Socially Negative (criticizes me)
☐ Overly Positive (unexpected praise)
☐ Lacks Evidence (how do you know?)
☐ Over-Generalized (uses "always", "never")
☐ Sensitive Topic (health, money, relationships)
☐ Ignores Context (doesn't explain why)
☐ Could Hurt Reputation (if shared publicly)
☐ Ambiguous Meaning (multiple interpretations)
☐ Tone Too Confident (overstated certainty)

QUESTION 3: What would you ask to clarify? (Open text)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Text box]                                  │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
