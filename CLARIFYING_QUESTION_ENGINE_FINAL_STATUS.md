# Clarifying Question Engine - Final Status Overview

## 🎯 System Purpose

Generate targeted clarifying questions for propositions flagged by the clarification detection system. When a proposition is flagged (e.g., "Arnav is working on a school project"), the system generates:
- **A clarifying question** directed at the user ("you") about the actual claim
- **A brief reasoning** (≤30 words) explaining why the question was asked
- **Evidence citations** (when available) showing which observations triggered the factor

## 🎯 Key Features

### Generation Methods

**Few-Shot** (Factors 3, 6, 8, 11):
- Uses 2-3 example questions to guide generation
- Good for nuanced disambiguation
- ✅ Tested and working

**Controlled QG** (Factors 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12):
- Structured prompts with politeness constraints
- Validation and retry logic
- ✅ Tested and working

### Quality Guarantees

✅ **All questions use "you"** - No third-person names
✅ **All questions ask about the claim** - Not about "the system"
✅ **Validation catches bad patterns** - System references, leading language
✅ **Retry logic** - Fixes validation failures automatically
✅ **Graceful degradation** - Continues processing on individual failures

## 📊 Proven Performance

### Real-World Testing (24 Questions Generated)

**Success Rate**: 24/24 (100%)
- ✅ All questions use "you" correctly
- ✅ Zero questions reference "the system"
- ✅ Zero questions use third-person names
- ✅ All questions ask about the actual claim

**Factors Tested**:
- Inferred Intent: 9 questions ✅
- Identity Mismatch: 8 questions ✅
- Opacity: 4 questions ✅
- Surveillance: 2 questions ✅
- Privacy: 1 question ✅

**Validation**:
- 17/24 fully valid (71%)
- 7/24 with minor politeness warnings (29%)
- 0/24 with critical errors

**Sample Questions** (verified correct):
- ✅ "Could you confirm if you are currently working on a document for a school project?"
- ✅ "Could you clarify if your choice of content in your writing reflects a personal or emotional connection?"
- ✅ "Are you using LinkedIn to network and explore opportunities, or for a different purpose?"

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Input (JSON/DB)
    ↓
question_loader.py → Load & normalize
    ↓
question_engine.py → Expand to (prop, factor) pairs
    ↓
question_generator.py → Generate question
    ├─→ Few-shot OR Controlled QG
    ├─→ OpenAI API (gpt-4o)
    └─→ Parse JSON response
    ↓
question_validator.py → Validate output
    ├─→ Retry if validation fails
    └─→ Extract evidence
    ↓
question_engine.py → Write JSONL
    ↓
Output file with all results
```

### Output Format

Each generated question includes:
```json
{
  "question": "Are you...",
  "reasoning": "This question...",
  "evidence": ["obs_123: ..."],
  "factor": "inferred_intent",
  "prop_id": 780,
  "prop_text": "Original proposition text...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-31T20:02:32.094058",
  "validation_errors": []  // Optional warnings
}
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Workarounds

### 1. Evidence Extraction ⚠️
**Issue**: File source has no observation objects (only preview strings)
**Impact**: Evidence field is empty for file-based processing
**Workaround**: Use database source OR accept empty evidence
**Priority**: Low (questions work fine without evidence)

### 2. Import Dependencies ⚠️
**Issue**: Requires sklearn, mss (optional now but still imported)
**Impact**: Import chain issues if dependencies missing
**Workaround**: Made imports optional with try/except
**Status**: Works but could be cleaner

### 3. Politeness Warnings ⚠️
**Issue**: Some questions flagged for politeness (soft validation)
**Impact**: Minor warnings, questions still work
**Priority**: Low (non-blocking)

### 4. Pytest Suite Not Run ⚠️
**Issue**: 221 tests exist but never executed
**Impact**: Unknown if all tests pass
**Workaround**: Install pytest and run them
**Priority**: Medium (should verify but not blocking)

### 5. Database Field Names ✅ Fixed
**Status**: All field name mismatches fixed
- `needs_clarification` (was `should_clarify`)
- `proposition.text` (was `proposition_text`)
- `observation.content` (was `observation_text`)
- `analysis.reasoning_log` (was `reasoning`)

### 6. Config Access ✅ Fixed
**Status**: Fixed `config.clarification.model` access pattern

### 7. Model Compatibility ✅ Fixed
**Status**: Changed from `gpt-4` to `gpt-4o` (supports JSON mode)

### 8. Prompt Instructions ✅ Fixed
**Status**: 
- Removed "reference system's observation"
- Added "ask about THE CLAIM, not the system"
- Added "use 'you', not names"

- Import chain broken → Fixed
- Database field mismatches → Fixed
- Config access wrong → Fixed
- Model compatibility → Fixed
- Prompt instructions wrong → Fixed
- System reference questions → Fixed
- Third-person names → Fixed
